# Planning Poker PWA

🃏 A Planning Poker Progressive Web Application for your team for your team to size up tickets

This uses PWA standards so you can install this app to your home screen, and use it offline, just like a native app. It doesn't take up megabytes of space either because it uses the browser's engine to render.

## Install

`yarn`

## To Run

`yarn start`

## Demo
